# playing_with_mnist

this is following 2 great tutaorials:
1) https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python
2) https://victorzhou.com/blog/keras-cnn-tutorial/

Here I build a neural network for hand written digits recognition training it on the famous MNIST data set. 
I am using Keras with TensorFlow backend. 

I analyse the results:
1) what were the most common mistakes?
2) what were the accuracy and loss after every epoch?
3) I visualise the intermediate images after 1st and 2nd CNN layers to get more intuition.
